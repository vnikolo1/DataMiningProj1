I wanted to add this piece, as a follow up for the project.

There were a number of mistakes that I made during the creation, and I recognize those. I do wonder if some people caught the misuse 
of data during some of the stats section.
Along with that, I didn't really know what to focus on or... do for this project, so it was a bit of a struggle.

I might come back to this at some point in time, but for now, I have neither the time nor the energy to commit in making 
fixes and changes to the code, the visuals, or anything else.

Thanks for sticking around, and look forward to improved projects!
